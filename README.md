Train Suspension Spring-Mass System – Numerical Simulation

This repository contains a MATLAB-based numerical simulation of a two-mass spring system, representing train suspension dynamics. The project implements Euler’s Method, Heun’s Method, and the Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method to solve the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the motion.

Features:

Mathematical Modeling: Formulates the spring-mass system using ODEs
Numerical Methods: Implements Euler, Heun, and RK4 for solving the equations
Error Analysis: Evaluates the accuracy and stability of each method
Visualization: Plots displacement and velocity of the masses over time
Technologies Used:
